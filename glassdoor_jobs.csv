What's the interview process like at ACG?


Applying for a job can feel intimidating and like a full-time job of its own.

It's our goal to provide you a fair, efficient interviewing experience that respects you and your time and to do it all with a sidecar of delight.

Once you submit an application, we'll review it. If you're a good fit, you'll have an initial chat with a recruiter over the phone. A phone interview with a manager typically follows. Depending on your role, you might then be asked to do a little homework (but nothing too time consuming). Then we'll bring you onsite to talk face to face, answer any questions you have, and give you a feel for what it's really like to work at ACG. If you're on the fence, just give it a try.

Before the dawn of everything internet, insurance was intimate and personal. You walked down the street to chat with your broker, and the risk to your business, your livelihood, was covered with a handshake. Today things are different. The average insurance policy for a mom-and-pop store trades through a dozen different hands and traverses a maze of systems and processes. Few are accountable and fewer know the whole story.

We seek a data scientist to help drive a new digital AI product team on a mission to unlock the potential of data and identify new opportunities.

The roadmap of projects you’ll work on that tie directly to business goals and objectives.
Manage the entire lifecycle of data projects from strategic planning to tactical activities (data collection, cleanup, analysis, model implementation).
Sourcing new data for a firm that rarely scrapes, pulls or pushes.
Facilitate communication throughout the development process between executive stakeholders, your users and technical teams.
Coordinate and build strong working relations with various internal stakeholder groups, including IT, engineering, and legal.

Postmates enables anyone to have just about anything on-demand. We pioneered the on-demand space and currently serve 3500+ cities with a fleet of more than 350,000 Postmates and the largest network of merchants in the US. We're changing the landscape of commerce by making cities our warehouses, providing the delivery infrastructure, and connecting our customers to any product, anywhere, anytime. Postmates isn't just an app, it's a way of life and a part of pop culture. We are the O.G. of on-demand and we've given people a new superpower — the ability to Postmate anything from anywhere. We're building a movement to make Postmates a verb: Postmate it.

WHAT WE DO


Postmates relies heavily on our engineering team to realize this vision. Building a software platform that is reliable, scales, and stays agile under demanding product needs is a serious technical challenge. Postmates is a three-part balancing act connecting customers, merchants, and couriers in real-time. If any piece is out of whack, the whole system suffers. Working with the Postmates engineering team offers an opportunity with explosive growth, cutting-edge technology, a highly visible charter, and a cool user-focused product vision.

Postmates runs one of the largest real-time delivery fleets in the country and collects a tremendous amount of data about those deliveries. And we view that data to be core to our product roadmap and business processes.

This team includes Data Engineers and Data Infrastructure Engineers. We're looking for engineers with a proven track record of shipping high-impact data systems. We care much more that you understand how to build simple, clear, and reliable tools than you have experience with any given toolset or pattern. We love learning, and we expect that you will learn new things and teach us new things as we build out the Postmates data infrastructure. The systems built in this team will have a critical impact on all our data pipelines by helping transition all Postmates services to an event-driven model, and helping build data-driven products that match our millions of customers to couriers in near real-time.

Background

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.

But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.

At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.

Our Company & Culture

We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win. Our primary focus this year is to continue to add exceptionally talented and motivated individuals to the Brightidea team. We are ambitious, bold, highly-collaborative, focused, and we aim to win. We take a humble approach to changing the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.

Anyone joining our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful then this could be the perfect team for you to shine in.

Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody.",4.3,"Brightidea

That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you.",4.7,"Object Partners

About Us VIDEO

Founded in 2013, Pivotal Software, Inc. combines our leading cloud-native platform, tools, and methodology to empower the world's largest organizations to adapt to change and build great software. Our technology unleashes developer productivity, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.

You

As a data scientist on Pivotal's Data Science team, you'll be working on a wide variety of data problems for a diverse range of clients. You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.

The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""

Us

The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.

Your Day

While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:
Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.
Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.
Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.
Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.
Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.
Required Skills / Experiences
Clear and empathetic communicator. You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.
Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods. These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.
Strong programming skills. Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.
Strong exploratory data analysis skills. Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.
Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset. We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.
At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field. This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.

This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.
Desired Skills / Experiences
2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).
Experience with relational databases.
Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment.
You have a specialization in an area like NLP, optimization, or image processing.
Hands-on experience working in a distributed computing environment or proven theoretical understanding of parallelism.

About Us:

Since our founding over 10 years ago, we’ve always been a different kind of company. After moving to New York from his native Turkey, our CEO Hamdi Ulukaya found that in America, yogurt just wasn’t as delicious or widely available as it was back home. He thought everyone deserved better options, so he set about making delicious, nutritious, natural, and accessible Greek Yogurt right here in the U.S.

Our mission since day one has been to provide better food to more people. And now as the No. 1-selling Greek Yogurt brand in America and the second largest overall yogurt manufacturer, we believe every food maker has a responsibility to provide people with better options, which is why we’re so proud of the way our food is made.

Our food philosophy of crafting quality products with simple ingredients is what makes Chobani a different kind of yogurt. Our belief that business done right has the ability to change lives and strengthen communities is what makes Chobani a different kind of company. From the way we source our ingredients to how we treat our employees, Chobani strives to make universal wellness happen sooner with everything we do. Certified as a Great Place to Work®, our culture is built on shared passion, dedication, and a commitment to doing what is right.

Data Scientist,$59K-$101K (Glassdoor Est.),"Hello Denver! We are excited to be here!
Snapdocs is an early-stage startup backed by investors like Sequoia, F-Prime Capital, SV Angel, and YCombinator looking for an empathetic and curious Data Scientist to join our small Data team. Are you interested in bringing an industry into the future with Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and automation? Then this role is for you.
We're a small team tackling the absolutely massive mortgage market. We're bringing modern, elegant software to a field that still relies on fax machines and manila envelopes. We bring security, efficiency and joy to a paper-based pillar of the US economy.

The type of problems we focus on involve workflow, product design, and data. Monolith vs microservices is an ongoing debate. We are working to find a good authentication pattern that allows for people to work across companies in multiple roles (which is trickier than you might think!). Domain Driven Design is our guiding light.

We trust our team members to make smart decisions. This means we value both independent work as well as collaboration. We're becoming ubiquitous in one segment of the market and now we're looking to hire another Data Scientist to help us expand further!

As the second Data Scientist to join the team, you will focus on aggregating and analyzing large datasets to identify behavior trends using statistics, data mining techniques, and building data models for solving real-world problems. The ideal candidate is someone who relishes pouring over messy data to find patterns and train machines to do so with high accuracy and recall. You will build and update models ( ML and AI ) to automate repetitive repeatable data-driven tasks. You will analyze data generated as a by-product of manual tasks and build models that can operate on similar or better accuracy than humans.

Over the past 2-4 years, you have learned and used advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms to build new models to experiment with data. You have experience in one or more programming languages including Python and R and have used Cloud Platforms, bonus points for AWS. This is a specialized role so advanced degrees in quantitative disciplines like Statistics, Computer Science, and Mathematics are preferred (PhD’s are ideal). Lastly, you are eager to learn! You don’t know every toolset but have proven that with the right problem, a good tutorial, and a healthy appetite for StackOverflow, you’ll figure it out but you don’t mind asking simple questions that result in actionable insights if need be.

Snapdocs’ culture is one that strongly values diversity and drive. We want to work with people of different backgrounds and different paths in life, and we trust our team members to make smart decisions. We value independent work as well as collaboration. Snapdocs provides a ton of excellent benefits ranging from the standard stuff: matching 401(k), free lunches, and 21 days PTO to the not so standard—like a 10 year exercise window on your options. Lastly, our location in downtown Denver is super convenient (we are currently based in the Wells Fargo Center) and close to many public transportation options.",5.0,"Snapdocs, Inc.

About LogRocket

LogRocket was founded in 2016 by Matthew Arbesfeld and Ben Edelstein, a computer science duo who have been building products together since the third grade. Frustrated by how difficult it was to understand their customers' experiences, Arbesfeld and Edelstein set out toward an audacious goal: to make every experience on the web as perfect as possible.

Our team is a diverse group that brings an eclectic set of experiences from Google, Meteor, Drift, HubSpot, MIT, and Columbia. We enjoy eating lunch together every day in our airy downtown Boston office, learning more about each other at our show-and-tell sessions, and hosting our friends during #logrocketeer events. We focus on building our software with care and craftsmanship — our engineering blog posts offer a taste of that — and we welcome talented people from all backgrounds. Many of us have important spaces in our lives, whether it be family, social organizations, schools, or former companies, and we're doing all we can to make LogRocket another one.

We are hiring a Data Scientist to join our growing Engineering and Data team. You will be spearheading projects across the organization to determine what data we collect and how, and which other sources we passively utilize to improve our day to day business processes.

Bring 4+ years of relevant working experience in a similar role, preferably with specific experience in the domain of time series demand or other forecasting
Have production-level experience with data querying languages (e.g. SQL), scripting languages (e.g. Python), and statistical/mathematical programming languages (e.g. R, Matlab)
Expertise with statistical analysis, applying various machine learning techniques, especially predictive modeling, to solve business problems
Bring a proven ability to think creatively, solve problems, learn quickly, work independently, handle ambiguity, and adapt to change in a fast-paced environment
Excellent written, verbal, and interpersonal communication and presentation skills

* You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.

* You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.

* You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

* You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.

* You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.

* You have up to 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role. Some of those years of experience may have been spent pursuing an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it's not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what's most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.

* You have some experience with big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, are able to write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start.

* Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. We are a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness, and we expect our data scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.

WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:


* You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.

* You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.

* You are a broadly skilled data scientist who may have experience working with embedded models in always-on production systems and may have worked across a variety of technologies and data sources.

* You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world's largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.

* You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.

* You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.

* You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE:


* You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.

* You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.

* You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.

* You have up to 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role. Some of those years of experience may have been spent pursuing an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it's not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what's most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.

* You have some experience with big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, are able to write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start.

* Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. We are a team built on a foundation of generosity and openness, and we expect our data scientists to help make others better and raise the bar for those around them.

WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:


* You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.

* You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.

* You are a broadly skilled data scientist who may have experience working with embedded models in always-on production systems and may have worked across a variety of technologies and data sources.

* You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world's largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.

* You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.

* You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.

* You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE:


* You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.

* You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.

* You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.

* You have up to 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role. Some of those years of experience may have been spent pursuing an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it's not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what's most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.

* You have some experience with big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, are able to write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

* You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.

* You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.

* You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

* You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.

* You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.

* You have up to 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role. Some of those years of experience may have been spent pursuing an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it's not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what's most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.

* You have some experience with big data technologies such as Spark and AWS, are able to write efficient SQL, and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start.

At Shelf Engine, we’re harnessing the power of AI to provide real-time, intelligent forecasting for food retailers like grocery stores, food service, and cafes across the United States. We’re able to drastically reduce the amount of shrink (food waste) which in turn drives profit for retailers, lowers costs for consumers, and reduces the ecological impact of waste. We’re using technology to solve a globally-relevant problem that both creates a positive environmental impact and an exciting (and potentially massive) commercial opportunity.

We are hiring a Data Scientist to join our growing Engineering and Data team. You will be spearheading projects across the organization to determine what data we collect and how, and which other sources we passively utilize to improve our day to day business processes. Your background in mathematics and business logic will directly impact the accuracy of our forecasting, striking a fine balance between reducing customers food waste, and avoiding understocking situations. Help us solve critical problems related to the following areas: time-series, demand forecasting, continuous models, feature/trend analysis, and probability distributions.
As a Data Scientist at Shelf Engine, you will:
Work cross-functionally (e.g. Product, Engineering, Operations, etc) to frame problems, both mathematically and within the business context; to measure and optimize products and business processes; to identify opportunities, assess risk potentials and explain trends; to drive customer adoption and revenue growth
Own the end-to-end experience with data, including querying, aggregation, deep analysis, visualization and models; presenting findings/actionable insights to internal and external stakeholders
Design, analyze, and run both simulated and live experiments (A/B and multivariate tests) to drive KPI improvement
Continuously improve the quality and accessibility of our analytical capabilities and framework as well as data reporting infrastructure
Assist in data requirements gathering and data validations to improve data platforms
And we think you would make a great Data Scientist if you:
Have a Masters degree in a related quantitative field (Computer Science, Math, Statistics, Engineering, Physics, Economics)
Bring 4+ years of relevant working experience in a similar role, preferably with specific experience in the domain of time series demand or other forecasting
Have production-level experience with data querying languages (e.g. SQL), scripting languages (e.g. Python), and statistical/mathematical programming languages (e.g. R, Matlab)
Expertise with statistical analysis, applying various machine learning techniques, especially predictive modeling, to solve business problems
Bring a proven ability to think creatively, solve problems, learn quickly, work independently, handle ambiguity, and adapt to change in a fast-paced environment
Excellent written, verbal, and interpersonal communication and presentation skills
